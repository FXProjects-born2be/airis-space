title: "Refund Policy"
---

This Refund Policy applies to the operator of the **Airis** AI-powered call center solution. By purchasing and using Airis services, you acknowledge that **all payments are final and non-refundable**, except in limited cases, as outlined below.

If you are unsure about committing to a specific Airis service plan, we recommend trying our **Pay-as-You-Go** solution, which allows you to experience the service and only pay for what you use.

## **Non-Refundable Payments**

All payments made for Airis services, including but not limited to **subscription plans, AI-driven call execution, lead filtering, callback scheduling, and reporting services**, are **final and non-refundable** once the transaction is processed. This policy applies to one-time purchases, recurring billing, and usage-based pricing.

## **Exceptions for Refund Requests**

While all payments are generally non-refundable, we may review refund requests on a case-by-case basis in the following circumstances:

- **Overpayment or Duplicate Charges** – If a client is mistakenly charged more than the invoiced amount or if a duplicate payment occurs, a refund may be processed upon verification.
- **Billing Errors** – If an error occurs due to a system malfunction, such as incorrect billing amounts, we will review the issue and provide a resolution.
- **Unauthorized or Fraudulent Transactions** – If a payment was made without authorization, clients must report it immediately for investigation.

Refund requests for technical issues **unrelated to billing errors** (e.g., AI classification results, call performance, or lead engagement outcomes) **do not qualify** for a refund. As outlined in our Terms of Use, Airis does not guarantee specific business results.

## **How to Request a Refund**

To request a refund under the outlined exceptions, clients must submit a written request via email to **\[Insert Email Address\]** with the following details:

- **Invoice number**
- **Payment date and amount**
- **Payment method used**
- **Reason for refund request**

Refund requests must be submitted within **10 business days** of the original transaction date. Failure to provide complete information may delay or result in denial of the request.

## **Processing Time**

If a refund is approved, it will be processed within **5 business days** using the original payment method. The timeframe for funds to appear in your account may vary depending on your payment provider.
