Welcome to AIris Space ("AIRIS," "we," "us," "our"). By using our services, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms. If you have any questions, please refer to the Contact Us section.

## Service Policies

### Payments & Refunds

- All payments made to AIRIS are non-refundable.
- Once payment is received and data is provided, the service is considered initiated, and cancellations will not result in a refund.
- If a client submits data, the payment cannot be canceled.

### Pitch Revisions

- AIRIS provides up to three (3) iterations per pitch for adjustments.
- Additional revisions are available for an extra fee.

### Lead Transfers & Client Responsibility

- AIRIS does not take additional fees on closed clients.
- Once leads are transferred, they become the full responsibility of the client.
- Any alternative arrangements will be agreed upon separately.

AIRIS is not responsible for any actions taken by the client after the lead has been transferred. Any consequences, including any potential harm or issues arising after the transfer, are solely the responsibility of the client.

## Data Handling & Client Responsibilities

### Use of Client Data

- AIRIS does not store, modify, or use client data beyond what is required to execute the campaign.
- Data is processed exclusively for lead engagement and redirection.
- The client is solely responsible for the accuracy, integrity, and security of the data provided.

### Data Compliance

- Clients must ensure that all provided data complies with relevant data protection and communication laws.
- AIRIS is not liable for any legal consequences arising from non-compliant data.
- If data is found to be non-compliant, all associated liabilities and penalties will be the client's responsibility.

## Live Call Monitoring & Transfer Policies

### Call Monitoring

- To ensure smooth lead transfers, AIRIS requires access to the client’s phone dashboard to monitor agent availability.
- If the client does not provide access, they assume full responsibility for monitoring agent availability.
- AIRIS is not responsible for missed call transfers due to unmonitored agent availability.

### Hot Transfers

- A hot transfer occurs when a lead is directly transferred from an AI call to a live agent.
- If a transfer is successful but the line drops and the live agent reconnects immediately or on the next attempt and the lead answers, it still counts as a transfer.
- If the lead does not answer, the transfer does not count.

### Scheduled Calls

- A scheduled call is a pre-arranged meeting through the AI system.
- Once scheduled, it is non-refundable, even if the client does not answer.
- If the AI system does not properly schedule the call, it will not count as a scheduled call.

## Service Limitations

### What AIRIS Provides

- AI-driven leads engagement through calls, live transfers, and follow-ups.
- Execution of the agreed-upon pitch, with up to three (3) iterations for optimization.
- Live transfer monitoring to ensure seamless handoffs to the client’s team.
- Detailed reporting, including lead statuses, call recordings, and transcripts.

### What AIRIS Is Not Responsible For

- Lead outcomes once transferred to the client.
