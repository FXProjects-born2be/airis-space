## **AI Limitations and No Guarantees**

Airis enhances call center efficiency through automated dialing, lead filtering, and intelligent callback scheduling. However, as with any AI-powered solution, its performance is based on predefined logic, machine learning models, and statistical analysis rather than human intuition. While Airis optimizes engagement strategies, it does not guarantee call outcomes, lead behavior, or conversion success.

The solution processes and categorizes leads based on available data, but this classification may not always reflect real-time interest or intent. Factors such as changes in customer preferences, external circumstances, or inaccurate lead data may affect results. Callback scheduling is determined based on AI predictions and user requests, but Airis cannot ensure that a lead will be available or willing to engage at the scheduled time.

Reports generated by Airis are intended as insights to assist businesses in decision-making. These reports should be used as guidance rather than definitive indicators of future customer actions. The accuracy of AI-driven analytics depends on multiple variables, including the quality of the provided data, customer responsiveness, and the overall market environment.

Airis is a tool to support and enhance call center operations, not a replacement for human judgment. Businesses remain responsible for interpreting AI-generated reports, making final decisions on lead engagement strategies, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations. Using Airis, clients acknowledge that results may vary and that no specific performance guarantees are provided.

## **Payment and Billing**

All payments for Airis services are **final and non-refundable** once the transaction is completed. By using Airis, clients agree to the pricing structure applicable at the time of purchase and acknowledge that no partial or full refunds will be issued under any circumstances. This policy applies to all service plans, including one-time purchases, subscription-based models, or usage-based pricing.

Clients are responsible for ensuring that payments are made **on time** to avoid service interruptions. Failure to complete payment by the due date may restrict access to Airis services until the outstanding balance is settled. Continued non-payment may lead to full suspension or termination of access to the solution. All scheduled services, including automated calls, lead filtering, and reporting, will be discontinued.

Airis reserves the right to modify pricing, billing terms, and payment structures anytime. Any changes to pricing or billing policies will be communicated in advance, and continued use of the solution after such updates constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

The client’s responsible for maintaining valid and up-to-date payment information to ensure uninterrupted service. In billing disputes, clients must contact Airis promptly to resolve the issue. However, disputing a charge does not exempt clients from their payment obligations.

## **Data Privacy and Security**

Airis processes client-provided data strictly to deliver the agreed services and does not sell or share this data with third parties. Robust security measures are in place to protect against unauthorized access, misuse, or data breaches. Clients are responsible for ensuring they have the legal rights and consent to use their data.

For full details on how we collect, store, and process data, please refer to our **Privacy Policy**.

## **Intellectual Property Rights**

Airis, including its underlying software, algorithms, processes, and service infrastructure, is the exclusive property of the provider. Clients are granted a **limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable** right to use the solution strictly for its intended business purposes. This right does not grant any ownership or modification rights over Airis or its components.

All AI-generated processes, automated scripts, and system functionalities remain proprietary, and any attempt to copy, reproduce, distribute, or modify them without prior written consent is strictly prohibited. Reverse engineering, decompiling, or otherwise attempting to extract the source code or operational mechanisms of Airis for any purpose, including commercial replication, is not allowed.

Clients retain full ownership of the **data they upload** to Airis and the **insights and reports explicitly generated** for their business use. However, this does not extend to the AI processing logic or methodologies used to derive those insights.

Any unauthorized use of Airis, including but not limited to developing a competing service using Airis methodologies or misrepresenting AI-generated insights as proprietary work, will result in legal action and potential damages.

## **Service Availability and Downtime**

Airis is designed to provide reliable and continuous service; however, we do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. Access to the solution may be temporarily affected due to **scheduled maintenance, system upgrades, unforeseen technical issues, or factors beyond our control**.

We strive to minimize disruptions and will notify clients in advance whenever possible for planned maintenance. However, unexpected downtime may occur without prior notice.

Airis is not responsible for business losses, missed opportunities, or disruptions from temporary service unavailability. Clients acknowledge that reliance on an AI-driven system carries inherent technical risks, and it is their responsibility to have contingency measures in place for critical operations.

## **Liability Limitations**

Airis provides AI-driven call center automation and lead management solutions to assist businesses in optimizing their outreach. However, clients acknowledge that AI-based processes, including lead classification, callback scheduling, and automated engagement, **do not guarantee specific business outcomes or conversions**.

Airis is **not responsible** for lost business opportunities, revenue, or potential customers resulting from AI-generated classifications, missed calls, or misinterpreted insights. Clients are responsible for using AI-generated reports, filtered leads, and engagement strategies in their business operations.

Furthermore, Airis **shall not be liable** for any **indirect, incidental, or consequential damages**, including but not limited to lost profits, reputational harm, operational disruptions, or financial losses arising from the use, inability to use, or reliance on AI-generated results. This limitation applies regardless of whether the client has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Using Airis, clients agree that the solution is a **supporting tool** rather than a decision-making authority. The client is responsible for reviewing, validating, and applying **AI-generated insights** within the context of their business strategy.

## **Termination of Services**

Airis reserves the right to **suspend or terminate service access** for clients who violate these Terms of Use, misuse the solution, or engage in unauthorized activities, including but not limited to fraudulent use, non-compliance with legal requirements, or attempts to manipulate or reverse-engineer the system. In such cases, termination may occur without prior notice, and no refunds will be issued.

Clients may choose to **discontinue their use of Airis at any time**, but termination of service **does not entitle them to a full or partial refund**. Once a payment has been made, it is final and non-refundable, as stated in the **Payment and Billing** section.

Airis also reserves the right to discontinue or modify services at its discretion. Clients will be notified in advance, whenever possible, of a service shutdown or major operational change. However, Airis assumes no liability for any losses incurred due to the termination or modification of its services.

## **Changes to Terms**

Airis reserves the right to update these Terms of Use at any time. Continued solution use after any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. Clients will be notified of significant updates through official communication channels.
