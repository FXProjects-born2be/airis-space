            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>
              EverBright Solar Solutionsâ€™ business success relied on fast,
              effective communication with homeowners interested in solar panel
              installations. However, manual follow-up processes were too slow
              and inconsistent:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Lead response time averaged 2 days, causing warm prospects to
                lose interest.
              </li>
              <li>
                Appointment booking rates were low, with only 6% of leads
                converting into consultations.
              </li>
              <li>
                A high no-show rate further undermined sales efforts, leading to
                wasted time and lost opportunities.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The company realized that to scale effectively and close more
              deals, they needed a faster, smarter lead engagement process
              without adding headcount.
            </p>
          </motion.div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
